# MERGE Feature Implementation Plan

The monolithic plan has been split into per-phase files under `.agents/plans/merge/`. Each file follows the naming pattern `NN[_sub]_Title.phase.md` (e.g., `01_Foundations_and_Scoping.phase.md`, `01.1_Baseline_Repair.phase.md`). Add new phases or sub-phases by creating additional files in that directory using the same convention.

## Active Phases
- [x] `01_Foundations_and_Scoping.phase.md`
- [ ] `01.1_Baseline_Repair.phase.md`
- [ ] `02_Parser_and_AST_Enhancements.phase.md`
- [ ] `03_Planner_and_Physical_Plan_Support.phase.md`
- [ ] `04_Execution_Engine_Changes.phase.md`
- [ ] `05_Storage_and_Utility_Updates.phase.md`
- [ ] `06_Testing_and_Validation.phase.md`
- [ ] `07_Documentation_and_Release_Tasks.phase.md`
- [ ] `08_Final_Verification_and_Handoff.phase.md`

Update the relevant phase file when work progresses. When a phase completes and new sub-phases are required, create the new `.phase.md` files before advancing.
