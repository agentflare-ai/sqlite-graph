## Known Limitations (Alpha)

### Current Limitations
1. **Limited Cypher Support**: Basic MATCH/WHERE/RETURN/CREATE working
   - Property projection in RETURN not yet implemented (returns whole node instead of property value)
   - Complex expressions not supported in WHERE (no AND/OR/NOT operators yet)
   - Aggregations not supported (COUNT, SUM, etc.)
   - No query modifiers (LIMIT, SKIP, ORDER BY)
   - Only forward relationships in MATCH (no `<-[r]-` or `-[r]-`)
   - No variable-length paths (e.g., `[r*1..3]`)
   - No relationship property access in WHERE
2. **Limited Algorithms**: Only basic connectivity and centrality
3. **Limited Pattern Matching**: Basic patterns work, but no optimization for complex multi-pattern queries
4. **No Query Optimization**: All queries use table scans, no cost-based optimization
5. **No Transaction Isolation**: Write operations not fully transactional
6. **String Values**: Must use double quotes in property maps (`{name: "Alice"}` not `{name: 'Alice'}`)

### Workarounds
- For property projection: Filter in application layer after getting nodes
- For complex WHERE conditions: Use SQL with `json_extract` functions
- For aggregations: Use SQL GROUP BY on backing tables
- Implement custom algorithms in Python using the SQL API
